## Face Detection and Recognition with OpenCV

This repository demonstrates the implementation of facial detection and recognition using OpenCV. The project is divided into two parts:
1. **Face Detection**: Detecting faces in images using Haar Cascades.
2. **Face Recognition**: Recognizing faces using Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) with OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (with Contrib modules)
- NumPy

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy
```

## Face Detection

The face detection script is available in the `face_recog.py` file. This script performs face detection and recognition on a given image. Make sure to provide the correct path to the image file you want to test.

## Face Recognition Training

The face recognition training script is available in the `faces_train.py` file. This script trains the face recognizer using images stored in the `images` directory. Ensure your image directory structure matches the one mentioned above.

## Notes on OpenCV's Built-in Face Recognizer

While OpenCV's built-in face recognizer (LBPH) is convenient and easy to use, it may not provide the highest accuracy for face recognition tasks, especially with larger and more diverse datasets. For more robust and accurate face recognition, consider using deep learning-based methods, such as those provided by libraries like Dlib or face_recognition, which leverage pre-trained models.
